Summary
-------
This repository collects course materials, notes, and practice code for learning LangGraph (building complex AI agents). It contains notes from an Eden (Udemy) LangGraph course and practice code from a FreeCodeCamp/YouTube crash course.

Repository structure
--------------------
- ReadMe.md — top-level overview (this file)
- Eden Udemy Course/ReadMe.md — notes for the LangGraph Udemy course by Eden
- FreeCodeCamp Crash Course/ReadMe.md — practice code and notes from the FreeCodeCamp/YouTube tutorial

Purpose
-------
Keep course links, notes, and example code organized so you can follow tutorials, reproduce examples, and experiment with agent designs in Python.

Getting started
---------------
1. Open the course folders to read notes and view example code.
2. If you add runnable examples, create and activate a Python virtual environment and install dependencies (example):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
